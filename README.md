# chat_app
a chat client made with raknet and imgui (yes i know raknet is very dated and that better libraries exist, i just really wanted to make something with raknet) unfortunately, you do need something like hamachi to connect with other people. other than that, its a fully functional chat client

also sorry for the really bad project management
